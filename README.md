# Damascus

This is a project for exploring the process of building a RTOS from scratch using the zig programming language.

The name Damascus comes from Damascus Steel, as the project comprises the bare metal realm.
No use of external libraries is allowed, just the cortex-M7 programming manual and the STM32-H7 hardware documentation.
